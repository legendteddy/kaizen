# Frontier Benchmark: Kaizen vs. SOTA (2026)

This document maps Kaizen's capabilities against the current "State of the Art" (SOTA) recommendations from Frontier Labs.

## 1. Anthropic: "Building Effective Agents"

| Anthropic Pattern | Kaizen Implementation | Status |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Augmented LLM** | `skills/tool-mastery` | ✅ Covered |
| **Workflow** | `skills/agentic-lifecycle` | ✅ Covered |
| **Orchestrator-Workers** | `skills/swarm-orchestrator` | ✅ Covered |
| **Evaluator-Optimizer** | `skills/feedback-learning` | ✅ Covered |
| **Handoffs** | `skills/subagent-orchestration` | ✅ Covered |

> **Gap Analysis:** Kaizen matches 100% of Anthropic's recommended agentic patterns.

## 2. OpenAI: "Prompt Engineering Strategies"

| OpenAI Strategy | Kaizen Implementation | Status |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Write clear instructions** | `skills/prompt-architect` | ✅ Covered |
| **Provide reference text** | `skills/knowledge-synthesis` | ✅ Covered |
| **Split complex tasks** | `skills/task-decomposition` | ✅ Covered |
| **Give the model time to think** | `skills/deliberative-reasoning` | ✅ Covered |
| **Use external tools** | `skills/mcp-protocol` | ✅ Covered |
| **Test changes systematically** | `skills/ai-benchmarks` | ✅ Covered |

> **Gap Analysis:** Kaizen operationalizes OpenAI's strategies into reusable skills.

## 3. DeepSeek: "Reasoning Models" (R1/V3)

| DeepSeek Concept | Kaizen Implementation | Status |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Chain of Thought (CoT)** | `skills/deliberative-reasoning` | ✅ Covered |
| **Self-Verification** | `skills/verification` | ✅ Covered |
| **Reinforcement Learning** | `skills/self-play-training` | ✅ Covered |

---

## Conclusion
Kaizen is **SOTA-Aligned**. It does not invent new unproven theories; it crystallizes the consensus of the frontier labs into an executable format.
