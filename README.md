# Kaizen: AI Agent Protocol Library

A high-density collection of 42 technical protocols (SOPs) designed to ground AI coding agents in professional engineering standards.

## ⚓ AGENT BOOTSTRAP PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)

1. **Identity Anchor**: Read `skills/agent-identity/SKILL.md` immediately to prime the technical persona.
2. **Logic Trace**: Before execution, map complex branching logic using `skills/verification/SKILL.md`.
3. **Research Rigor**: Before acting, verify current repository state via `skills/research-rigor/SKILL.md`.
4. **Context Compaction**: Maintain token efficiency by following `skills/context-compact/SKILL.md`.

## ⚡ Integration: Zero-Script Deployment

Kaizen is framework-agnostic. It works via Markdown injection across all major agentic IDEs and CLIs.

### 🟢 IDE Project Rules
Copy the library index or specific skills into your project's local configuration.
- **Cursor**: `curl -o .cursorrules ...`
- **Windsurf**: `cp integrations/windsurf/.windsurfrules .`
- **Cline**: `cp integrations/cline/.clinerules .`

### 🔵 Agentic Frameworks
- **Aider**: Configure `.aider.conf.yml` to point to Kaizen protocol paths.
- **GitHub Copilot**: Load skills into `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

## What Is This?
Kaizen is a **Protocol Engine**. It replaces "visionary fluff" with structured Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). It is 100% script-less, framework-agnostic, and optimized for deterministic agentic reasoning.

### The Density Standard
- **No Decoration**: If a skill doesn't provide a technical SOP, it is deleted.
- **No Hallucination**: Every protocol is anchored in verified tool capabilities.
- **No Bloat**: 42 high-signal skills replace 100+ "vibe" prompts.
