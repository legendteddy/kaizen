> **æ”¹å–„** (Kaizen) â€” The Japanese philosophy of continuous improvement, now for AI agents.

**The most comprehensive self-evolving AI skills framework.** 65 actionable skills. Works with Gemini CLI, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and all LLM agents.

*5x more skills than alternatives. The only framework with self-evolution and purpose understanding built-in.*

## Why Kaizen?

| Problem | Kaizen Solution |
|:---|:---|
| AI agents make the same mistakes | Skills library prevents repeat errors |
| Agents don't understand your intent | **Step Zero** forces purpose understanding |
| Generic responses, no domain expertise | 74 specialized skills |
| No memory between sessions | Long-term memory protocols |
| Agents don't improve over time | **Self-evolution loop** built-in |

---

## Quick Start (30 seconds)

```bash
# Clone into your project or global location
git clone https://github.com/your-username/kaizen.git
```

Then tell your AI agent:

> **"Read KAIZEN.md and activate it."**

That's it. Your agent is now self-evolving.

### 4 Lifecycle Hooks

Automatic triggers at key moments:
- `session_anchor` â€” Anchor objectives at start
- `pre_tool_audit` â€” Safety check before actions
- `post_tool_verify` â€” Verify results after actions
- `context_compact` â€” Compress memory at limits

## Key Innovations

### Step Zero: Purpose Understanding

**Before doing ANYTHING, understand WHY.**

Every action â€” code, research, planning, conversation â€” begins with understanding:
1. What does the user **actually** want?
2. **Why** do they want it?
3. What does **success** look like?
4. What **constraints** exist?

*If you don't understand the purpose, you cannot verify success.*

### The Kaizen Loop: Self-Evolution

> **Note:** "Self-evolution" means the AI agent updates its own instruction files. The files do not change themselves.

```
OBSERVE → Notice patterns in your work
ANALYZE → Identify what could be better
IMPROVE → Update skills or create new ones
VALIDATE → Test the improvement
REPEAT  → Never stop evolving
```

Agents using Kaizen don't just complete tasks — they get **better** at completing tasks.

### Predictive Evolution: Self-Improving Framework

The framework predicts its own gaps and improves itself:
- Missing skill detected â†’ Create new skill
- Weak skill found â†’ Strengthen it
- Pattern repeated â†’ Extract to reusable pattern
- Mistake made â†’ Add guard to prevent recurrence

---

## What to Expect

Agents using Kaizen typically experience:

| Benefit | Why |
|:---|:---|
| Fewer repeated mistakes | Skills encode lessons learned |
| Better first attempts | Step Zero ensures understanding |
| Consistent quality | Patterns provide proven templates |
| Faster debugging | Systematic debugging methodology |
| Continuous improvement | Self-evolution is built-in |

*Results depend on your use case and how you integrate the framework.*
