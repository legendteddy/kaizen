> **Kaizen** (Japanese: continuous improvement) - The philosophy of continuous improvement, now for AI agents.

**A systematic cognitive framework for AI agents.** 74 actionable skill protocols. Works with Gemini CLI, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and all LLM agents.

*Focuses on purpose understanding (Step Zero) and structured reasoning patterns to ensure consistent, production-grade agent behavior.*

## Why Kaizen?

| Problem | Kaizen Solution |
|:---|:---|
| AI agents make the same mistakes | Skills library prevents repeat errors |
| Agents don't understand your intent | **Step Zero** forces purpose understanding |
| Generic responses, no domain expertise | 74+ specialized skills |
| No memory between sessions | Long-term memory protocols |
| Agents don't improve over time | **Self-evolution loop** built-in |

## Quick Start (30 seconds)

### Option A: Automatic Installer (Recommended)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/legendteddy/kaizen.git
cd kaizen
python install.py
```
*Follow the wizard to configure Cursor, Claude, or Gemini automatically.*

### Option B: Manual Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/legendteddy/kaizen.git
```
Then tell your AI agent:
> "Read KAIZEN.md and activate it."

[**See Full Skills Index**](SKILLS.md)

### 4 Lifecycle Hooks

Automatic triggers at key moments:
- `session_anchor` - Anchor objectives at start
- `pre_tool_audit` - Safety check before actions
- `post_tool_verify` - Verify results after actions
- `context_compact` - Compress memory at limits

---

## Key Innovations

### Step Zero: Purpose Understanding

**Before doing ANYTHING, understand WHY.**

Every action begins with understanding:
1. What does the user **actually** want?
2. **Why** do they want it?
3. What does **success** look like?
4. What **constraints** exist?

*If you don't understand the purpose, you cannot verify success.*

### The Kaizen Loop: Self-Evolution

```
OBSERVE -> Notice patterns in your work
ANALYZE -> Identify what could be better
IMPROVE -> Update skills or create new ones
VALIDATE -> Test the improvement
REPEAT  -> Never stop evolving
```

Agents using Kaizen don't just complete tasks - they get **better** at completing tasks.

### Predictive Evolution: Self-Improving Framework

The framework predicts its own gaps and improves itself:
- Missing skill detected -> Create new skill
- Weak skill found -> Strengthen it
- Pattern repeated -> Extract to reusable pattern
- Mistake made -> Add guard to prevent recurrence

---

## What to Expect

Agents using Kaizen typically experience:

| Benefit | Why |
|:---|:---|
| Fewer repeated mistakes | Skills encode lessons learned |
| Better first attempts | Step Zero ensures understanding |
| Consistent quality | Patterns provide proven templates |
| Faster debugging | Systematic debugging methodology |
| Continuous improvement | Self-evolution is built-in |

*Results depend on your use case and how you integrate the framework.*
