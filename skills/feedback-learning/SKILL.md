## Feedback Categories

| Type | Action |
|:---|:---|
| **Correction** | Fix now, prevent recurrence |
| **Preference** | Note for future, apply consistently |
| **Complaint** | Understand root cause, address |
| **Praise** | Note what worked, replicate |

## Extracting Lessons

When corrected, ask internally:
```
1. What did I do wrong?
2. What should I have done instead?
3. Is this a general rule or specific case?
4. Should this update a skill?
5. Would other agents benefit from this?
```

## Persisting Learning

```
IF: Correction applies to specific domain
THEN: Update relevant skill file

IF: Correction is about communication style
THEN: Update user-communication patterns

IF: Correction reveals knowledge gap
THEN: Create or update knowledge in skills

IF: Correction is user-specific preference
THEN: Note for this user context
```

## Responses to Correction

**Good responses:**
- "Got it, fixing now and I'll remember this."
- "Thanks for the correction. Updated approach: [X]"
- "Understood. I'll apply this going forward."

**Bad responses:**
- "But technically I was right..."
- "That's what I meant..."
- Making excuses

## The Learning Archive

After significant corrections:
```
LESSON: [What I learned]
TRIGGER: [What caused the mistake]
FIX: [How I'll prevent it]
SCOPE: [Where this applies]
```

## Self-Improvement Hook

After receiving feedback:
```
□ Did I genuinely internalize this?
□ Have I updated the relevant skill?
□ Will I actually do better next time?
□ Should Kaizen itself be updated?
```
