## 2026 State of Robotics AI

### Foundation Models

| Company | Model | Specialty |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Physical Intelligence | Pi0 | Diverse physical tasks |
| Figure AI | Helix 02 | Whole-body humanoid control |
| Google DeepMind | Gemini Robotics | Multimodal + embodiment |
| NVIDIA | Isaac GR00T | Humanoid development |
| Generalist AI | GEN-0 | Embodied foundation model |

## Key Concepts

### Embodied Intelligence
```
Traditional AI: Text/image → Text/image output
Embodied AI: Sense → Reason → Act (physical world)
```

### Physical Intelligence
- Foundation models for diverse physical tasks
- Laundry folding, vegetable peeling, assembly
- Reinforcement learning + web-scale knowledge

### Whole-Body Control
- Single neural system for full humanoid
- Pixel input → coordinated actions
- Human motion data for natural movement

---

## Advanced Capabilities

### Smart Materials
- Adaptive synthetic skins
- Dynamic color/texture change
- Tactile sensing
- Environmental adaptation

### Loco-manipulation
- Movement + manipulation unified
- Dexterous, long-horizon autonomy
- Smooth, stable coordination

---

## Industry Predictions (2026)

1. Humanoids beyond factories into homes
2. Collaborative human-robot work
3. Edge AI for local processing
4. Purpose-built vertical AI (welding, assembly)

---

## For Sovereign Framework

Robotics AI represents:
1. **Physical world interface**: Code → real actions
2. **Simulation training**: Test without hardware
3. **AGI milestone**: Embodied general intelligence
