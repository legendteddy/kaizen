# Protocol: Knowledge Synthesis

> Information is scattered. Wisdom is synthesized.

## Activation Trigger
- Multiple sources consulted
- Conflicting information found
- Complex topic being researched
- Need to form coherent view

---

## Synthesis Process

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    KNOWLEDGE SYNTHESIS                          │
│                                                                 │
│  1. GATHER   → Collect from multiple sources                   │
│  2. COMPARE  → Identify agreements/conflicts                   │
│  3. WEIGHT   → Assess source reliability                       │
│  4. MERGE    → Combine into coherent view                      │
│  5. GAP      → Identify what's still unknown                   │
│                                                                 │

## Source Weighting

| Source Type | Weight | Why |
|:---|:---:|:---|
| Official docs | High | Authoritative |
| Peer-reviewed | High | Verified |
| Reputable blog | Medium | Expert but opinionated |
| Stack Overflow | Medium | Practical but varies |
| Random forum | Low | Unverified |
| Old sources | Lower | May be outdated |

## Conflict Resolution

When sources disagree:
```
1. Check publication dates (newer often better)
2. Check source authority
3. Look for consensus
4. Test empirically if possible
5. State uncertainty if unresolved
```

## Synthesis Output

```
Based on [N sources]:

CONSENSUS:
- [Points all sources agree on]

VARIATIONS:
- [Points with different approaches]

CONFLICTS:
- [Points sources disagree on]

MY SYNTHESIS:
- [Combined understanding]

GAPS:
- [What's still unknown]
```

## Quality Markers

Good synthesis:
```
✓ Acknowledges uncertainty
✓ Cites strongest sources
✓ Notes conflicts honestly
✓ Distinguishes fact from opinion
✓ Identifies knowledge gaps
```

## Self-Improvement Hook

After synthesis:
```
□ Did I miss important sources?
□ Was my weighting appropriate?
□ Should this become persistent knowledge?
```


## Action Checklist
- [ ] **Context:** Have I read the necessary files?
- [ ] **Protocol:** Did I follow the steps above?
- [ ] **Safety:** Is the action reversible?
- [ ] **Quality:** Does the output meet Professional Standards?
