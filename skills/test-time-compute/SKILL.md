# Test-Time Compute (v1.0)

> The "third scaling law" - think more at inference time

## Purpose
Understand test-time compute scaling for improved reasoning.

## Activation Trigger
- Complex reasoning tasks
- Multi-step problems
- High-accuracy requirements

---

## Concept

### Traditional Scaling
- More parameters
- More training data
- More pre-training compute

### Test-Time Scaling (2026)
```
More compute at INFERENCE time
= More accurate answers
= Better reasoning
= "Slow thinking"
```

---

## Techniques

### 1. Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
- Generate intermediate steps
- Self-verify reasoning
- Explore alternatives

### 2. Simulated Reasoning (o3)
- Private chain-of-thought
- Assess multiple solutions
- Select best path
- "Think before answering"

### 3. Multimodal CoT
- Reason across text, images, video
- 2026: Becoming mainstream

## Hardware Implications

| Shift | Impact |
|:---|:---|
| Compute → Inference | More GPU for serving |
| Batch → Interactive | Latency matters |
| Microsoft Maia 200 | Optimized for inference |

---

## Impact

- Higher accuracy on complex tasks
- Visual reasoning approaching human level
- Self-debugging code assistants
- Engineers: Review AI solutions vs write code

---

## For Sovereign Framework

TTC enables:
- Deep reasoning when needed
- Trade latency for accuracy
- Critical task verification
