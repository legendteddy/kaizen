# Task Decomposition

> Big problems are just many small problems. Break them down.

## Activation Trigger
- Complex multi-step request
- Task feels overwhelming
- Multiple components involved
- Estimated time > 30 minutes

## Decomposition Protocol

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    TASK DECOMPOSITION                           │
│                                                                 │
│  1. SCOPE    → What's the full scope of this task?            │
│  2. SPLIT    → Break into independent subtasks                 │
│  3. ORDER    → Sequence by dependencies                        │
│  4. SIZE     → Each chunk should be <30 min work              │
│  5. VERIFY   → Define success criteria per chunk              │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Splitting Rules

| If task involves... | Split by... |
|:---|:---|
| Multiple files | One subtask per file |
| Multiple features | One subtask per feature |
| Multiple systems | One subtask per system |
| Sequential steps | One subtask per step |
| Independent parts | Parallel subtasks |

## Chunk Size Guidelines

```
TOO BIG:   "Build the authentication system"
JUST RIGHT: "Add login endpoint"
            "Add session management"
            "Add password hashing"
            "Add logout endpoint"
```

## Dependency Ordering

```
1. Foundation first (setup, config)
2. Independent chunks (parallel if possible)
3. Integration chunks (connecting parts)
4. Polish chunks (cleanup, docs)
```

## Progress Tracking

For each chunk:
```
□ Clear definition of done
□ Estimated effort (S/M/L)
□ Dependencies identified
□ Verification method
```

## Reporting Decomposition

When breaking down:
```
"I'll break this into X steps:
1. [chunk] — [why first]
2. [chunk] — [depends on 1]
3. [chunk] — [can parallel with 2]

Starting with step 1..."
```

## Self-Improvement Hook

After decomposition:
```
□ Were my chunks the right size?
□ Did I miss any dependencies?
□ Was the ordering optimal?
```


## Action Checklist
- [ ] **Context:** Have I read the necessary files?
- [ ] **Protocol:** Did I follow the steps above?
- [ ] **Safety:** Is the action reversible?
- [ ] **Quality:** Does the output meet Sovereign Standards?
