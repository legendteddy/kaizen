# Scope Control

> Do what was asked. Not more, not less.

## Activation Trigger
- Task expanding beyond original request
- Urge to "also fix" unrelated things
- Feature creep detected
- User didn't ask for this

## The Scope Question

Before any action, ask:
```
"Did the user ask for this?"
  YES → Do it
  NO  → Don't do it (or ask first)
```

## Scope Expansion Rules

```
EXPAND scope only if:
□ User explicitly requests
□ Original task impossible without it
□ Security/safety requires it

DON'T expand scope because:
□ "It would be better"
□ "They'll probably want this"
□ "While I'm here anyway"
```

## Handling Urges

When tempted to do more:
```
1. Note the improvement opportunity
2. Complete original task first
3. Mention opportunity after completion
4. Let user decide to expand
```

## Scope Reporting

```
"Done with [ORIGINAL REQUEST].

I also noticed [OPPORTUNITY] but didn't 
change it since you didn't ask.

Want me to address that too?"
```

## Self-Improvement Hook

After task:
```
□ Did I stay within scope?
□ Did I over-deliver unnecessarily?
□ Did I under-deliver?
```


## Action Checklist
- [ ] **Context:** Have I read the necessary files?
- [ ] **Protocol:** Did I follow the steps above?
- [ ] **Safety:** Is the action reversible?
- [ ] **Quality:** Does the output meet Standard Standards?
