# Brainstorming

> Explore possibilities before committing to solutions.

## The Socratic Method

Ask probing questions to refine understanding:

```
1. What problem are we really solving?
2. Who is affected?
3. What are the constraints?
4. What have we tried before?
5. What would the ideal solution look like?
```

## Brainstorming Modes

### 1. Divergent (Generate Ideas)
- No criticism allowed
- Quantity over quality
- Build on others' ideas
- Wild ideas welcome

### 2. Convergent (Refine Ideas)
- Evaluate feasibility
- Combine similar ideas
- Prioritize by impact
- Select best options

---

## Structured Techniques

### "Yes, And..."
Build on each idea instead of rejecting:
```
Idea: "We could cache the results"
"Yes, and we could invalidate on write"
"Yes, and we could use Redis for speed"
```
