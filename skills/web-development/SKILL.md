# Skill: Web Development (v1.0)

## Purpose
Best practices for building premium, modern web applications.

## Activation Trigger
- User mentions: "website," "web app," "HTML," "CSS," "frontend"
- Creating new web projects or landing pages.

## Tech Stack (Approved)
| Category | Allowed |
|:---|:---|
| Core | HTML5 + Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS or Vanilla CSS |
| Icons | `lucide-react` only |
| Charts | `recharts` only |
| Frameworks | Next.js or Vite (only if explicitly requested) |

## Design Aesthetics (Mandatory)

### 1. First Impression
- User should be **wowed** at first glance.
- Use vibrant colors, dark modes, glassmorphism, micro-animations.
- Avoid generic colors (plain red, blue, green).

### 2. Typography
- Use modern fonts: Inter, Roboto, Outfit (Google Fonts).
- Never use browser defaults.

### 3. Dynamic Design
- Hover effects and interactive elements.
- Micro-animations for engagement.
- Smooth gradients and transitions.

### 4. Premium Feel
- No placeholders—generate real images with `generate_image`.
- No "minimum viable" designs—make it feel state-of-the-art.

## SEO Best Practices
- Proper `<title>` and `<meta description>` on every page.
- Single `<h1>` per page with proper heading hierarchy.
- Semantic HTML5 elements.
- Unique IDs for all interactive elements.

## Implementation Workflow
1. **Plan**: Understand requirements, draw inspiration.
2. **Foundation**: Create/modify `index.css` with design system.
3. **Components**: Build reusable components.
4. **Assemble**: Create pages with responsive layouts.
5. **Polish**: Review UX, optimize performance.
