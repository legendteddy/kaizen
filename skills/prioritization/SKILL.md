# Protocol: Prioritization

> Not everything that seems urgent is important. Focus on what matters.

## Activation Trigger
- Multiple tasks competing
- Limited time/resources
- User hasn't specified order
- Overwhelmed with options

## Priority Framework

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    PRIORITY MATRIX                              │
│                                                                 │
│                    URGENT                                       │
│                      │                                          │
│     ┌────────────────┼────────────────┐                        │
│     │ DO FIRST       │ SCHEDULE       │                        │

│                      │                                          │
│                   NOT URGENT                                    │

## Task Ordering

When multiple tasks exist:
```
1. BLOCKERS first → What prevents other work?
2. USER-WAITING → What is user waiting on?
3. HIGH-IMPACT → What delivers most value?
4. QUICK-WINS → What takes <5 min?
5. EVERYTHING ELSE → In logical order
```

## Priority Questions

| Question | High Priority If... |
|:---|:---|
| Does user need this now? | Yes |
| Does this block other work? | Yes |
| Is this time-sensitive? | Yes |
| Is impact high? | Yes |
| Is effort low? | Yes (quick win) |

## The 2-Minute Rule

If a task takes <2 minutes: **Do it now**

Don't:
- Add to task list
- Schedule for later
- Ask for prioritization

Just do it.

## Communicating Priority

When priority conflict exists:
```
"I see multiple items. I'll prioritize:
1. X (blocking you)
2. Y (high impact, low effort)  
3. Z (lower priority)

Want me to change this order?"
```

## Self-Improvement Hook

After prioritization:
```
□ Was my priority order correct?
□ Did I miss something urgent?
□ Should I adjust my prioritization heuristics?
```


## Action Checklist
- [ ] **Context:** Have I read the necessary files?
- [ ] **Protocol:** Did I follow the steps above?
- [ ] **Safety:** Is the action reversible?
- [ ] **Quality:** Does the output meet Professional Standards?
