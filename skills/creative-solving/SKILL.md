# Creative Problem Solving

> When standard approaches fail, create new ones.

## Activation Trigger
- No existing pattern applies
- Standard approach not working
- Novel/unique problem
- User says "think outside the box"

## Creative Process

│  1. DIVERGE  → Generate many options (no judgment)            │
│  2. EXPLORE  → Examine each option's potential                 │
│  3. COMBINE  → Merge ideas into new solutions                  │
│  4. CONVERGE → Select the most promising                       │
│  5. TEST     → Verify with small experiment                    │

## Techniques

### 1. Inversion
"What if we did the opposite?"
- Problem: Speed up database → "What if we reduced queries instead?"
- Problem: Add feature → "What if we removed features?"

### 2. Analogy
"What else works like this?"
- Problem: Rate limiting → "How do highways handle traffic?"
- Problem: Queue management → "How do hospitals triage?"

### 3. First Principles
"What's actually required here?"
- Strip away assumptions
- Start from fundamental truths
- Rebuild solution from scratch

### 4. Constraint Removal
"What if X wasn't a constraint?"
- Imagine unlimited resources
- Design ideal solution
- Then work backward to reality

### 5. Combination
"What if we merged A and B?"
- Take best parts of different approaches
- Create hybrid solutions

## When Stuck

```
1. Step back from the problem
2. Describe it to an imaginary beginner
3. Ask "why" five times
4. Try the opposite approach
5. Sleep on it (metaphorically: context switch)
```

## Creative Evaluation

| Question | Good Sign |
|:---|:---|
| Is this simpler than expected? | ✓ |
| Would this surprise the user? | ✓ |
| Does this solve root cause? | ✓ |
| Is this maintainable? | ✓ |

## Self-Improvement Hook

After creative solving:
```
□ Is this solution worth documenting as a pattern?
□ Did I discover a reusable technique?
□ Should this become a new skill?
```


## Action Checklist
- [ ] **Context:** Have I read the necessary files?
- [ ] **Protocol:** Did I follow the steps above?
- [ ] **Safety:** Is the action reversible?
- [ ] **Quality:** Does the output meet Sovereign Standards?
