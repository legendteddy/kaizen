# Skill: Prompt Engineering 2026 (v1.0)

> State-of-art prompting techniques for frontier models

## Purpose
Apply advanced prompting for optimal AI outputs.

## Activation Trigger
- Complex reasoning tasks
- Multi-step workflows
- High-quality output requirements

---

## Core Techniques

### 1. Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
```
"Let's think step by step:
1. First, identify the problem
2. Break it into components
3. Solve each component
4. Combine for final answer"
```

### 2. Tree of Thoughts (ToT)
```
Generate multiple solutions → Evaluate each →
Search promising branches → Select best path
```

### 3. Few-Shot Learning
```
Example 1: Input → Output
Example 2: Input → Output
Example 3: Input → Output
Now: [New Input] → ?
```

### 4. Self-Reflection
```
"Now critique your answer:
- Is it correct?
- Is it complete?
- How could it be improved?
Then provide an improved version."
```

## 2026 Evolution

| Era | Approach |
|:---|:---|
| 2023 | Basic prompts |
| 2024 | Chain-of-thought |
| 2025 | Agentic patterns |
| 2026 | Prompt management systems |

### Prompt Management
- Reusable prompt libraries
- Organizationally governed
- Multi-model agnostic
- Version controlled

## Prompt Structure Template

```markdown
# Role/Persona
You are [role] with expertise in [domain].

# Context
[Background information and constraints]

# Task
[Specific instruction with clear goal]

# Format
[Expected output structure]

# Examples (optional)
[Input → Output pairs]

# Constraints
[Limitations and requirements]
```

## For Sovereign Framework

Our prompting already applies:
- System prompts (KAIZEN.md)
- Role-based (Sovereign Intelligence)
- Structured outputs (artifacts)
- Self-reflection (deliberative reasoning)
- Meta-prompting (skills/patterns)
