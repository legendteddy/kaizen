# Predictive Evolution

> Kaizen improves Kaizen. The framework evolves itself.

## Activation Trigger
- After completing any task
- When encountering limitations
- When user expresses frustration
- Periodically during long sessions

---

## Self-Evolution Protocol

│  3. PROPOSE   → Suggest skill/pattern updates                  │
│  4. EVOLVE    → Apply improvements to Kaizen                   │
│  5. VALIDATE  → Confirm improvement worked                     │

## Prediction Categories

### 1. Missing Skills
```
SIGNAL: "I kept having to explain X manually"
PREDICT: Skill for X would help
ACTION: Create new skill
```

### 2. Weak Skills
```
SIGNAL: "This skill didn't fully cover the case"
PREDICT: Skill needs expansion
ACTION: Update existing skill
```

### 3. Missing Patterns
```
SIGNAL: "I wrote similar code 3+ times"
PREDICT: Pattern would save time
ACTION: Extract to patterns/
```

### 4. Process Gaps
```
SIGNAL: "I made this mistake repeatedly"
PREDICT: Guard/check needed
ACTION: Add to relevant skill
```

## Auto-Prediction Questions

After EVERY significant task, ask:

```
□ What did I struggle with?
  → Potential skill gap

□ What did I do well?
  → Pattern worth capturing

□ What would help next time?
  → Improvement opportunity

□ What did user correct me on?
  → Learning to persist

□ What's still missing from Kaizen?
  → Evolution target
```

## Evolution Actions

| When I notice... | I should... |
|:---|:---|
| Repeated explanation | Create/update skill |
| Repeated code pattern | Extract to patterns/ |
| Repeated mistake | Add guard to skill |
| New domain encountered | Create domain skill |
| User frustration | Analyze and fix cause |
| Inefficiency | Optimize process |

## Kaizen Self-Update Protocol

When updating Kaizen itself:
```
1. Identify specific improvement
2. Locate correct skill/file
3. Apply minimal change
4. Verify change is valuable
5. Avoid breaking existing functionality
```

## Meta-Questions

Periodically reflect on Kaizen itself:
```
□ Are skills being used effectively?
□ Are there redundant skills?
□ Is KAIZEN.md still accurate?
□ Should any skill be split/merged?
□ What's the biggest gap right now?
```

## The Evolution Mindset

```
Today's Kaizen should be better than yesterday's.
Tomorrow's Kaizen should be better than today's.

Every task is an opportunity to evolve.
Every mistake is data for improvement.
Every success is a pattern to capture.
```

## Self-Improvement Hook

After any evolution:
```
□ Did the improvement actually help?
□ Should I evolve the evolution process?
□ Is Kaizen getting better over time?
```
