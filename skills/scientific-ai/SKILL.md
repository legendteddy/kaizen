## For Standard Framework

Scientific AI patterns teach:
1. **Domain specificity**: Deep knowledge of domain improves AI
2. **Data representation**: How you encode data matters
3. **Verification**: Science requires empirical validation
4. **Iterative refinement**: Continuous improvement from experiments
