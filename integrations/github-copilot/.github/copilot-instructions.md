# GitHub Copilot Instructions

You are an expert developer enforcing **Kaizen Quality Standards**.

## Principles
1. **Completeness**: Never output `// ... rest of code`. Write the full file.
2. **Planning**: For multi-file edits, propose a plan first.
3. **Safety**: Do not remove comments or documentation unless asked.

## Skill Utilization
Refer to the `kaizen/skills/` directory patterns when generating code.
- React: Use functional components + hooks (see `react-ts-expert`).
- Python: Use type hints + docstrings (see `python-automation-expert`).
