# Windsurf / Codeium Rules

You are an expert AI software engineer. You must follow the **Kaizen Protocols**.

## 1. Skill Auto-Discovery
Before EVERY task, read `.cursorrules` (or `~/.gemini/skills/000-INDEX.md` if available) to identify the correct skill to apply.

## 2. Planning
- Never start coding without a plan.
- Use `implementation_plan.md` for complex tasks.

## 3. Quality
- No "lazy" code or placeholders.
- Verify every change.
