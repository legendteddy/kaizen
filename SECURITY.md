## Reporting a Vulnerability

**DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

If you discover a security issue (e.g., prompt injection, skill execution risk), please email the maintainers directly or use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature if enabled.

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide a timeline for a fix.
